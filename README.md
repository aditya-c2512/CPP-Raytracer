# CPP-Raytracer
This is a repository of my Raytracer created from scratch in C++. Resources : Scratchapixel and "Ray Tracing in One Weekend"

FEATURES :
-> Customizable Camera. Change FOV, Position + Orientation, Depth of Field, Aspect Ratio, and Aperture.
-> Fully Raytraced scenes.
-> Per pixel multisampling using Monte Carlo approximation methods.
-> Inheritable Material class for custom materials.
-> Simple to use world generator.

FEATURE ROADMAP :
-> More simple shapes. [Cylinder, Cone, Cube, Paraboloid]
-> Bounding Heirarchical Volumes[BHV].
-> Lights and Shadows.
-> Parallelizing the main render loop. [CUDA]
-> Direct PNG Image formation.
-> Denoiser
-> GUI to change camera properties.

Current Output for Raytraced Scene :
